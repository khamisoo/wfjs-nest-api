## ðŸ§© BPMN Workflow Manager (JSON-based)

This NestJS-based module enables **creation, update, deletion, and monitoring of BPMN workflows using JSON** (without requiring diagram editors or BPMN XML directly).

### ðŸ“¦ Modules Used

- `@nestjs/common` â€“ Core decorators and services
- `@nestjs/mongoose` â€“ MongoDB integration via Mongoose
- `mongoose` â€“ MongoDB schema/model layer
- `bpmn-moddle` â€“ Converts JSON structure into BPMN 2.0 XML
- `fs` and `path` â€“ File system operations for saving workflows
- `process.cwd()` â€“ Ensures BPMN files are saved in the project root

### ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Users send JSON-formatted workflow definitions via the `/workflows` POST endpoint.
2. The JSON is transformed into BPMN XML using `bpmn-moddle`.
3. The `.bpmn` file is saved inside the app root directory under `/bpmn/`.
4. Workflow metadata is stored in MongoDB: name, status, current step, timestamps.
5. A set of RESTful routes allow full CRUD operations and step tracking.

### ðŸ”„ Supported Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                        | Description                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/workflows`                    | Create a workflow from JSON          |
| PATCH  | `/workflows/:name`              | Update a workflow by name            |
| DELETE | `/workflows/:name`              | Delete workflow and mark as deleted  |
| GET    | `/workflows`                    | List all workflows                   |
| GET    | `/workflows/:name`              | Get full workflow data + BPMN XML    |
| GET    | `/workflows/:name/status`       | Get status and current step          |
| PATCH  | `/workflows/:name/step`         | Update current step by ID            |

### âœ… Example JSON Payload

```json
{
  "name": "invoice-process",
  "json": {
    "id": "Definitions_1",
    "targetNamespace": "http://bpmn.io/schema/bpmn",
    "rootElements": [
      {
        "$type": "bpmn:Process",
        "id": "Process_1",
        "isExecutable": true,
        "flowElements": [
          { "$type": "bpmn:StartEvent", "id": "StartEvent_1" },
          { "$type": "bpmn:Task", "id": "ApproveInvoice" },
          { "$type": "bpmn:Task", "id": "SendToFinance" },
          { "$type": "bpmn:Task", "id": "GenerateReceipt" },
          { "$type": "bpmn:EndEvent", "id": "EndEvent_1" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
````

### ðŸ“‚ File Storage

* All `.bpmn` files are saved in:

  ```
  <your-project-root>/bpmn/<workflow-name>.bpmn
  ```

* Handled using:

  ```ts
  path.join(process.cwd(), 'bpmn')
  ```
